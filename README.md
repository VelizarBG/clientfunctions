# Client Functions (Fabric)

This mod allows players with sufficient permissions to execute bundles of commands(functions) on the fly without data packs. The default keybind for opening the GUI is `B` but you can change it. All functions you execute will be saved in a history. You can browse it in the GUI via the arrow buttons or via `CTRL + SCROLL WHEEL`. In the config file or the Mod Menu integration you can choose how you want your history to be saved.

## Dependencies

This mod requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config). Additionally, you can install [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) if you want more configuration. Alternatively, you can just modify the config file `clientfunctions.json5` inside `.minecraft/config`.

## Server and client

In order for this to work on dedicated servers the mod is required to be on it too.
